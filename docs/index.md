# REST API

This is the API reference documentation for the Joyent Manta Storage
Service, which enables you to store data in the cloud and process that data
using the built-in compute facility.

This document covers only the HTTP interface and all examples are given in curl.

Before you do the examples in this section, it's important to go through the
examples using the CLI and setting up your environment.

* [Getting Started](index.html)

There are also detailed reference materials:

* [Object Storage Reference](storage-reference.html)
* [Compute Jobs Reference](jobs-reference.html)
* [Multipart Uploads Reference](mpu-reference.html)

## Conventions

Any content formatted like this:

    $ curl -is https://us-east.manta.joyent.com

is a command-line example that you can run from a shell. All other examples and
information are formatted like this:

    GET /my/stor/foo HTTP/1.1


# Authentication

There are a few access methodologies. The predominant means of
authenticating requests to the service is to use the
[HTTP Signature](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-00)
over TLS.

In most situations, you will only need to sign the lowercase `date: ` and value
of the HTTP `Date` header using your SSH private key; doing this allows you to
create interactive shell functions (see below).  All requests require an HTTP
Authorization header where the scheme is `Signature`.

Full details are available in the `http signatures` specification, but a simple
form is:

    Authorization: Signature keyId="/:login/keys/:fp",algorithm="rsa-sha256",signature="$base64_signature"

The `keyId` for the service is always
`/$your_joyent_login/keys/$ssh_fingerprint`, and the supported algorithms are:
`rsa-sha1`, `rsa-sha256` and `dsa-sha`. The ssh key fingerprint must be a MD5
fingerprint (ex. `a1:b2:c3:d4:e5:f6:a7:b8:c9:d0:e1:f2:a3:b4:c5:d6`)

To make a request for an RBAC subuser, change the `keyId` for the signature to
`/$your_joyent_login/$subuser_login/keys/$ssh_fingerprint`. To make a request
using a RBAC role, include the HTTP header `Role`.

## Signed URLS

It can be desirable to share "expiring links" with someone via a
simple link, suitable for a web browser or email client.  In these cases, the service
supports a "signed URL" scheme, as an alternative to making programmatic REST
requests (there is no Authorization header).  Signed URLs are the only exception
to the HTTPS-only requirement of the service; you are allowed to perform GET requests
only over HTTP via this mechanism to avoid "mixed content" errors in some web
browsers.  The query string must at minimum must contain the same identifying
parameters that would be in the Authorization header (user, keyId, algorithm).
Additionally it *must* contain an `expires` parameter, which is a time the URL
is valid until, specified as the number of seconds from the Unix epoch.

To construct a signed URL, you:

+ Start with the HTTP Request Method + a new line
+ Add the value of the HTTP Host header + a new line
+ Add the HTTP Request URI, minus any query parameters + a new line
+ Add a line of the HTTP query parameters, sorted lexicographically, and where
  the keys and values are encoded as per
  [RFC3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt).

Formalized:

    HTTP REQUEST Method + '\n'
    Host Header + '\n'
    HTTP REQUEST URI + '\n
    key=val&key=val... (query parameters, url, sorted lexicographically)

For example, suppose you wanted to share a link to
`https://us-east.manta.joyent.com/$MANTA_USER/stor/image.png`.  The following
would be the signing string (newlines inserted for readability):

    GET\n
    us-east.manta.joyentcloud.com\n
    /$MANTA_USER/stor/image.png
    algorithm=RSA-SHA256&expires=1354201912&keyId=%2F$MANTA_USER%2Fkeys%2F8e%3A36%3A43%3Aac%3Ad0%3A61%3A60%3A18%3A20%3Af5%3Ab7%3Aec%3A3a%3Ad8%3A79%3A2d

You would sign that entire string with your private key, URL encode the
signature and then append it to the URL query string:

    https://us-east.manta.joyent.com/$MANTA_USER/stor/image.png?algorithm=RSA-SHA256&expires=1354201912&keyId=%2F$MANTA_USER%2Fkeys%2F8e%3A36%3A43%3Aac%3Ad0%3A61%3A60%3A18%3A20%3Af5%3Ab7%3Aec%3A3a%3Ad8%3A79%3A2d&signature=RR5s5%2Fa0xpwvukU2tn3LAe2QRHGRJVdbWu%2FQZk%2BYgnVmuWI59n8EG0G6KN5INp30r7xC0EOSMvgmyfrLFQTG1482fNsjedwfFXVZq0%2BeUV6dI36pe69FxMuRKh4ILy47l6wCqD4qvFsFwmeqmzfkn03MmU15JsJt2yqTtnz%2FGkToZCpaHugW5YferGNeAY%2FrTwLTrB%2BrsKovY35rK9eokPbJTDlNx97JX5%2F7ol3cgtRbstLuROfpCycJ5OxC3NAeXeUD7weGQxAY6ypoEq5HFiZoA3gT4lDdYyO7LKKPkE8dSqcqVqgdtflpf%2FYibKwGg5Vm%2F9Ze%2Fwq%2Bsb1RgSAJsA%3D%3D

## Interacting with the Joyent Manta Storage Service from the shell (bash)

Most things in the service are easy to interact with via [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/),
but note that all requests to the service must be authenticated.  You can string
together [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/) and [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/)
with a bash function.

Copy all of below:

      function manta {
		    local alg=rsa-sha256
		    local keyId=/$MANTA_USER/keys/$MANTA_KEY_ID
		    local now=$(date -u "+%a, %d %h %Y %H:%M:%S GMT")
		    local sig=$(echo "date:" $now | \
		                tr -d '\n' | \
		                openssl dgst -sha256 -sign $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa | \
		                openssl enc -e -a | tr -d '\n')

		    curl -sS $MANTA_URL"$@" -H "date: $now"  \
		        -H "Authorization: Signature keyId=\"$keyId\",algorithm=\"$alg\",signature=\"$sig\""
		}

Paste into `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc` and restart your terminal to pick up the changes.

    pbpaste > ~/.bash_profile

And edit the file, replacing `$JOYENT_CLOUD_USER_NAME` with your actual cloud username.

This all is setup correctly you will be able to:

    $ manta /$MANTA_USER/stor
    $ manta /$MANTA_USER/stor/moved -X PUT -H "content-type: application/json; type=file"
    $ manta /$MANTA_USER/stor/foo -X PUT -H "content-type: application/json; type=directory"
    $ manta /$MANTA_USER/stor -X GET
    {"name":"foo","type":"directory","mtime":"2013-06-16T05:42:56.515Z"}
      {"name":"moved","etag":"bfaa3227-3abb-4ed6-915a-a2179f623172","size":0,"type":"object","mtime":"2013-06-16T05:42:45.460Z"}

All sample "curl" requests in the rest of this document use the
function above.  Throughout the rest of the document, the value of the
Authorization header is simply represented as `$Authorization`.

# Errors

All HTTP requests can return user or server errors (HTTP status codes >= 400).
In these cases, you can usually expect a JSON body to come along that has the following
structure:

    {
      "code": "ProgrammaticCode",
      "message: "human consumable message"
    }

The complete list of codes that will be sent are:

- AuthSchemeError
- AuthorizationError
- BadRequestError
- BucketAlreadyExists
- BucketNotEmpty
- BucketNotFound
- ChecksumError
- ConcurrentRequestError
- ContentLengthError
- ContentMD5MismatchError
- EntityExistsError

|| UserTaskError  || User's script returned a non-zero status or one of its processes dumped core. ||

# Directories

## PutDirectory (PUT /:login/stor/[:directory]/:directory)

PutDirectory in the Joyent Manta Storage Service is an idempotent create-or-update operation.  Your private
namespace starts at `/:login/stor`, and you can then create any nested set
of directories or objects underneath that.  To put a directory, simply set the
HTTP Request-URI to the path you want to update, and set the `Content-Type` HTTP
header to `application/json; type=directory`.  There is no request or response
body.  An HTTP status code of `204` is returned on success.

### Sample Request

    $ manta /$MANTA_USER/stor/foo \
        -X PUT \
        -H 'content-type: application/json; type=directory'

    PUT /$MANTA_USER/stor/foo HTTP/1.1
    Host: us-east.manta.joyent.com
    Accept: */*
    content-type: application/json; type=directory
    Date: Thu, 29 Nov 2012 23:48:00 GMT
    Authorization: $Authorization

    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
    Date: Thu, 29 Nov 2012 23:48:00 GMT
    Server: Manta
    x-request-id: 3591a050-3a7f-11e2-b95c-a921ce711752
    x-response-time: 16
    x-server-name: 00aa9214-0855-474d-92b5-8f713495b8d7
    Connection: keep-alive

## ListDirectory (GET /:login/stor/:directory)

Lists the contents of a directory. On success you will receive a `\n`
separated stream of JSON objects, where each object represents a single
directory entry.  The content-type will be `application/x-json-stream;
type=directory`.  Each object will have a `type` field, which indicates whether
the entry is a directory or an object. For example (additional newlines added
for clarity):

    {
        "name": "1c1bf695-230d-490e-aec7-3b11dff8ef32",
        "type": "directory",
        "mtime": "2012-09-11T20:28:30Z"
    }

    {
        "name": "695d5de6-45f4-4156-b6b7-3a8d4af89391",
        "etag": "bdf0aa96e3bb87148be084252a059736",
        "size": 44,
        "type": "object",
        "mtime": "2012-09-11T20:28:31Z"
    }

The `type` field indicates the "schema" for each record; the only types are
currently `object` and `directory`. Both have a `name` (filename), `type`
(already described) and an `mtime`, which is an ISO8601 timestamp of the last
update time.  Additionally, records of type `object` have a `size`
(content-length) and `etag` (for conditional requests).

You will get back entries in blocks of *256* (you can opt for less, or more by
setting the `limit` parameter on the query string).  You can choose where to
start the next listing by using the `marker` query parameter.  You'll get the
*total* number of records in the `result-set-size` header. The service lists objects
in alphabetical order (UTF-8 collation).

### Query Parameters

||**Name**||**Description**||
||limit||limits the number of records to come back (default and max is 1000)||
||marker||key name at which to start the next listing||

### Returns

A stream of JSON objects, one record for each child.

## DeleteDirectory (DELETE /:login/stor/:directory)

Deletes a directory. The directory must be empty.  There is no response data
from this request.  On success an HTTP `204` is returned;

### Sample Request

    $ manta /$MANTA_USER/stor/foo -X DELETE

    DELETE /$MANTA_USER/stor/foo HTTP/1.1
    Host: us-east.manta.joyent.com
    Accept: */*

    Connection: keep-alive

# Objects

## PutObject (PUT /:login/stor/[:directory]/:object)

Creates or overwrites an object.  You specify the path to an object just as you
would on a traditional file system, and the parent must be a directory.  The service
will do no interpretation of your data.  Specifically, that means your data is
treated as an opaque byte stream, and you will receive back *exactly* what you
upload.  On success an HTTP `204` is returned.

By default, The service  will store two copies of your data on two physical servers in
two different datacenters; note that each physical server is configured with
RAID-Z, so a disk drive failure does not impact your durability or availability.
You can increase (or decrease) the number of copies of your object with the
`durability-level` header.

You should always specify a `Content-Type` header, which will be stored and
returned back (HTTP content-negotiation will be handled).   If you do not
specify one, the default is `application/octet-stream`.

You should specify a `Content-MD5` header; if you do the service will validate that
the content uploaded matches the value of the header.  Even if you do not include
one, successful responses will include a `computed-md5` header. This is the MD5
checksum that Manta calculated when ingesting your object.

The service is able to provide test/set semantics for you if you use HTTP conditional
request semantics (e.g., `If-Match` or `If-Modified-Since`).

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing [CORS](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) headers are
saved as appropriate; preflighted requests are supported by sending a list of
values in `access-control-allow-origin`.

By default, the service will store 2 copies of your object; this can be changed with
the `durability-level` header.

Note that if you are using "streaming uploads" (transfer-encoding chunked), you
are either subject to the default object size in the service (5Gb), or you need to
"guess" how big your object is going to be by overriding with the HTTP header
`max-content-length`.  Either way, the service will track how many bytes were
_actually_  sent and record that. Subsequent GET requests will return the actual
length.  If you're not streaming, just set `content-length` (as you normally
would).

Lastly, you can store custom headers with your object (e.g. "tags") by prefixing
them with `m-`.  So for example, including the header `m-local-user: foo` with
an object will allow you to track that some local user to your application
created the object.  You are allowed up to 4 KB of header data.

### Sample Request

    $ manta /$MANTA_USER/stor/foo.json -X PUT -H 'content-type: application/json' \
            -d '{"hello": "world"}'

    PUT /$MANTA_USER/stor/foo.json HTTP/1.1
    Host: us-east.manta.joyent.com
    Accept: */*

    Connection: keep-alive

## PutMetadata (PUT /:login/stor/[:directory]/:object?metadata=true)

PutMetadata allows you to overwrite the HTTP headers for an already existing
object, without changing the data. Note this is an idempotent "replace"
operation, so you must specify the complete set of HTTP headers you want stored
on each request.

You cannot change "critical" headers:

- Content-Length
- Content-MD5
- Durability-Level

### Sample Request

    $ manta /$MANTA_USER/stor/foo.json?metadata=true -X PUT \
            -H 'content-type: application/json'

    PUT /$MANTA_USER/stor/foo.json?metadata=true HTTP/1.1
    Host: us-east.manta.joyent.com
    Accept: */*

# Jobs

## CreateJob (POST /:login/jobs)

Submits a new job to be executed. This call is not idempotent, so calling it
twice will create two jobs.  On success, an HTTP `201` is returned with the URI
for the job in the `Location` header.

* `memory` must be one of the following: 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192
* `disk` must be one of the following: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024
* `exec` may be any valid shell command, including pipelines and other shell
  syntax.  You can also execute programs stored in the service by including them in
  "assets" and referencing them as /assets/$manta\_path.
* `init` has the same constraints as `exec`, but is executed in each compute
  zone before any tasks run

## AddJobInputs (POST /:login/jobs/:id/live/in)

Submits inputs to an already created job, as created by [CreateJob](#CreateJob).

Inputs are object names, and are fed in as a `\n` separated stream (content-type
as `text/plain`). Inputs will be processed as they are received.

An HTTP `204` is returned on success.

### Sample Request

## EndJobInput (POST /:login/jobs/:id/live/in/end)

This "closes" input for a job, and will finalize the job.  If there are
reducers, you likely won't see output until after this is called.  There is no
input to this API.  On success an HTTP `202` is returned.


### Sample Request

## CancelJob (POST /:login/jobs/:id/live/cancel)

This cancels a job from doing any further work. Cancellation is asynchronous and
"best effort"; there is no guarantee the job will actually stop. For example,
short jobs where input is already closed will likely still run to completion.
This is however useful when:

- input is still open
- you have a long-running job

On success an HTTP `202` is returned.

## ListJobs (GET /:login/jobs)

Returns the list of jobs you currently have.  This is a streaming JSON payload
that will be identical to listing a directory.  Note you can filter the set of
jobs down to only `live` jobs by using the query parameter `?state=running`.

On success, an HTTP `200` is returned with a stream of `job` objects
(see [CreateJob](#CreateJob)).  Note a content-length header will not be sent
back.

# Multipart Uploads

## CreateMultipartUpload (POST /:login/uploads)

Creates a new mulitpart upload. This call is not idempotent, so calling it
twice, even with the same inputs, will create two mulitpart uploads.  On
success, an HTTP `201` is returned with a JSON document containing the URI for
the multipart upload and its ID in the response body.

### Inputs

The body of this request must be a JSON document with the following properties:

||**Name**||**JS Type**||**Description**||
||objectPath||String||*(required)* the Manta path where the target object will be stored||
||headers||Array(String)||(optional) an array of headers to store on the target object||

Headers supplied in the request body will be stored as headers on the target
object when the multipart upload is committed.  Headers may only be provided
when the multipart upload is created and cannot be changed until after the
target object has been committed.  As with all Manta objects, you are allowed
4 KB of header data.

The following headers are supported for target objects:

- Content-Length
- Content-MD5
- Durability-Level


The following headers are not supported and will cause the request to fail with
a MultipartUploadInvalidArgumentError:

- If-Match
- If-None-Match
- If-Modified-Since
- If-Unmodified-Since

Unsupported headers may change in future revisions.

### Sample Request

To use the sample request data below exactly, replace $MANTA_USER with your
Manta login.

## UploadPart (PUT /:login/uploads/[0-f]+/:id/:partNum)

Creates or overwrites a part for a multipart upload.  This operation generally
functions like the PutObject operation, with some key differences highlighted
below.  On success, an HTTP `204` is returned.

As with PutObject, an etag for the part is returned in the "Etag" header of the
response.  The service uses etags and part numbers to identify parts when the
multipart upload is committed, so you should save this value to use for the
CommitMultipartUpload operation.

The service will store the number of copies specified in the `Durability-Level`
header input to CreateMultipartUpload when the multipart upload was created, or
two copies if no durability level was specified.  As with all target object
headers, the durability level cannot be changed once a multipart upload is
created.

As with the PutObject operation, you may specify a `Content-MD5` header for the
part, which the service will verify matches the data uploaded.  Unlike
PutObject, conditional request semantics (e.g., `If-Match` or
`If-Modified-Since`) are not supported for UploadPart.

The multipart upload API requires a minimum part size of 5 MB for all parts
except the last one. This size is validated when CommitMultipartUpload is
called.  UploadPart operations will succeed even if the part is under the
minimum size.

Any part number between 0 and 9999 is valid, but committing a multipart upload
requires consecutive parts starting from part 0.  See
[CommitMultipartUpload](#CommitMultipartUpload) for details.

## CommitMultipartUpload (POST /:login/uploads/[0-f]+/:id/commit)

Commits the multipart upload with the input set of parts.
This operation is atomic and idempotent.  Once a multipart upload is committed,
it cannot be aborted or committed with a different set of parts, though the
operation may be safely retried with the same inputs.  On success, an HTTP `201`
is returned with the URI of the target object in the `Location` header.  The
URI of the target object is the same as the "objectPath" specified when the
multipart upload was created.

### Inputs

The body of this request must be a JSON document with the following properties:

||**Name**||**JS Type**||**Description**||
||parts||Array(String)||*(required)* array of etags of parts to commit, in order, starting from part 0||

The service will verify that the part etags specified in the input array match
what is currently in Manta and that all parts, except the last part, meet the
minimum part size of 5 MB.  Additionally, the service will verify that the
caller has permissions to operate on the "objectPath" URI specified when the
multipart upload was created.

### Sample Request

    $ cat commit.json
    {
        "parts": [
            "92a9e0de-9498-46bf-b559-0da424a5ea77",

## AbortMultipartUpload (POST /:login/uploads/[0-f]+/:id/abort)

Aborts the multipart upload.  This operation is atomic and idempotent.  Once a
multipart upload has been aborted, it cannot be committed, but the
AbortMultipartUpload operation may safely be retried.  On success, an HTTP `204`
is returned.

# Multipart Upload Redirect Endpoints

To allow clients to resolve a multipart upload's URI based only on its upload
ID, requests to `/:login/uploads/:id` and `/:login/uploads/:id/:partNum` will
redirect the request to the multipart upload's fully qualified parts directory.
On success, an HTTP `301` is returned, with the parts directory URI in the
"Location" response header.

### Sample Request

    $ manta /$MANTA_USER/uploads/d52da3a7-a55c-4961-b95a-84fbfc5d7903

If the multipart upload does not exist, the redirect endpoints will return an
HTTP `404`:
