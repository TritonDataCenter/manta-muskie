/*
 *  This file contains the majority of the logic for handling multipart uploads.
 *
 *  API OVERVIEW:
 *
 *  The Manta multipart upload API allows clients to upload a Manta object
 *  by splitting it into parts and uploading the parts individually. When all
 *  parts are uploaded, the client signifies that the upload is completed by
 *  "committing" the upload through the API, which creates a Manta object
 *  that is the concatenation of the uploaded parts and is indistinguishable
 *  from an object created through a normal Manta PUT. If a client decides not
 *  to finish the upload, it may also abort the upload process.
 *
 *  The possible operations in the multipart upload API are:
 *      - create: establish a multipart upload
 *      - upload-part: upload a part of the object
 *      - abort: cancel the upload
 *      - commit: complete the upload
 *      - get: get information about an ongoing upload
 *
 *  There is an additional API endpoint designed for client usability purposes
 *  that redirects all requests sent to the path /:account/upload/:id to the
 *  correct upload path. See the comment in `redirect.js` for details.
 *
 *
 *  TERMINOLOGY:
 *
 *  There is some terminology that is used consistently throughout the
 *  multipart upload implementation that is useful to know:
 *
 *   - Upload ID: a uuid representing a multipart upload request, selected
 *     when the upload is created. There are two generations of how upload IDs
 *     are selected; see the "UPLOAD IDS" section for details.
 *
 *   - Upload Path: The path where parts of an upload are uploaded to and
 *     stored in Manta. This is different from the target object path.
 *
 *   - Upload Record: The Manta directory record for the upload path. This
 *     record contains state about the upload recording in an additional
 *     "upload" blob tacked onto the record. The upload record gives us a
 *     mechanism of passing state about an upload across muskie requests.
 *
 *   - Target Object: The object that is intended to be created when the upload
 *     is committed.
 *
 *   - Target Object Path: An input to creating an upload, this refers to the
 *     path in Manta where the target object will be stored once the upload is
 *     committed.
 *
 *   - Target Object Record: The Manta object record for the target object.
 *
 *   - Finalizing Record: A Manta record, stored in a special multipart uploads
 *     bucket (namely, the "manta_uploads" bucket), that is guaranteed to exist
 *     on the same shard as the target object record. The key of this record is
 *     constructed using both the target object path and the upload ID. (By
 *     constructing the key this way, we allow for different multipart uploads
 *     for the same target object path, whether they are simultaneous or not.)
 *     The presence of a finalizing record for a given target object path and
 *     upload ID pair indicates that an upload has been "finalized" -- either
 *     committed or aborted.
 *
 *  METADATA STRUCTURE:
 *
 *  Because most of the state about an upload is stored in metadata records in
 *  Moray, it is important to have a well-defined structure for what this
 *  information looks like.
 *
 *   - Upload Record: This record has the same structure as a typical Manta
 *     directory record, with an additional object called "upload" that has
 *     the following structure:
 *
 *      upload {
 *          id,             // upload id
 *          state,          // state of the upload: CREATED or FINALIZING
 *          type,           // if state is FINALIZING, then ABORT or COMMIT
 *          objectPath,     // target object path
 *          objectPathKey,  // the Moray key for the target object path
 *          uploadPath,     // upload path
 *          headers,        // headers to store on object record
 *          sharks,         // mako sharks the object is stored on
 *          partsMD5,       // for a commit, the MD5 sum of the parts etags
 *          objectId,       // object ID for the target object
 *          creationTimeMs  // mpu creation time in ms since epoch
 *      }
 *
 *    - Finalizing Record: This record has the same structure as a typical Manta
 *     directory record, with an additional object called "upload" that includes
 *     the following fields:
 *      upload {
 *          uploadId,           // upload id
 *          finalizingType,     // ABORT or COMMIT
 *          objectPath          // target object path
 *          objectId            // target object id
 *          md5                 // MD5 sum of the object (returned from mako)
 *      }
 *
 *    - Object Record: The object record is a normal Manta object record, but
 *      there are a few fields on the object that are set explicitly by the
 *      multipart upload code, instead of the common metadata code.
 *
 *      In particular, the following fields are set explicitly:
 *        - objectId: This is generated when the object is created and is
 *          needed for mako-finalize.
 *        - contentLength: This is set either by the user when creating the
 *          upload (and validated by the commit endpoint), or it is
 *          calculated on commit.
 *        - contentMD5: This is set either by the user when creating the
 *          upload (and validated by the commit endpoint), or it is
 *          calculated on commit.
 *        - headers: This is set by the user when creating the upload.
 *        - sharks: These are selected when the upload is created.
 *
 *  UPLOAD IDS:
 *
 *  Upload IDs are uuids. They are unique to a multipart upload under a given
 *  account. To preserve a real directory structure, most API endpoints for
 *  multipart upload require the full Manta path. The one exception is the
 *  redirect endpoint, which maps uuids to their full path.
 *
 *  There are two generations of how upload IDs are generated. Muskie supports
 *  both of them for redirects, but the modern scheme is used for all new
 *  multipart uploads.
 *
 *  In the first version (or "legacy" version), upload IDs were randomly
 *  generated uuids.
 *
 *  In the modern version, upload IDs are generated in two steps:
 *    (1) A random uuid is generated.
 *    (2) The last character of the uuid is replaced by the current prefix
 *    length for muskie, encoded as a hex value.
 *
 *  The modern scheme allows the server to deterministically generate the upload
 *  path for a multipart upload given only the upload ID, ensuring a maximum of
 *  one metadata request to determine if the upload exists for an id using this
 *  scheme. This property is particularly useful for the multipart upload
 *  redirect endpoint (see the comment in `redirect.js` for details).
 *
 *  The prefix length is encoded in the last character of the id. The last
 *  character is used mostly for convenience. It might seem even more convenient
 *  to encode it in the first character. Such a scheme would be problematic. The
 *  purpose of the prefix directories is to prevent unbounded growth in the
 *  top-level "uploads" directory, and the random assignment of upload
 *  directories to prefix directories prevents unbounded growth of the prefix
 *  directories. A fixed first character in the prefix would deterministically
 *  assign uploads to, at best, a handful of prefix directories, and undermine
 *  this design goal.
 *
 *  The '0' hex value is reserved. If this scheme needs to be altered, the '0'
 *  character provides a value to switch on to differentiate between the modern
 *  version and any future schemes.
 *
 *  Because this scheme still generates valid uuids, there is no way to tell
 *  from a given upload ID whether it was generated with the legacy scheme or
 *  the modern scheme. In cases where it is necessary to determine this, both
 *  can be tried. For more details, see the comment in `redirect.js`.
 *
 *  AUTHORIZATION:
 *
 *  Generally, MPU actions are authorized against the resource /:account/uploads
 *  (for MPU creation) or /:account/uploads/[0-f]/:id (other MPU actions).
 *  Subusers are not allowed to perform multipart uploads.
 *
 *
 *  IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
 *
 *  The logic of this API is implemented as methods on the MultipartUpload
 *  object defined in this file. When a multipart upload related request comes
 *  in to muskie, a new MultipartUpload request is constructed, and sets up
 *  some state the various handlers will need.
 *
 *  After an upload's creation, most of the state about the upload is stored in
 *  the upload record. After validating inputs to a request, the first thing a
 *  multipart upload API endpoint should do is call the method uploadState(),
 *  which will load the upload record from Moray and allow the handlers to
 *  fetch state from the record using the get() method, and modify the record
 *  using the set() method.
 *
 *  Once the API handlers have completed the relevant logic based on the
 *  upload's state, they each call a relevant method on the upload object
 *  ({create,abort,commit,get}Upload()). These methods take care of saving
 *  the upload record back to Moray, and perform any additional metadata
 *  transformations as needed.

 * Multipart upload parts are stored in the directory:

 * we want to divide uploads roughly evenly into subdirectories.
 * Because uuids are randomly generated, we expect that they would be uniformly
 * distributed based on the first $PREFIX_LENGTH characters of the upload id.
 *
 * We default to a $PREFIX_LENGTH of 1 -- that is, /:account/uploads will have
 * a maximum of 16 directories. If needed, this value can be tuned in SAPI to
 * allow for more ongoing multipart uploads.
 *
 * There are tradeoffs to having a higher prefix length value. A smaller prefix
 * allows all multipart uploads to be enumerated faster, as it requires fewer
 * requests. A larger prefix supports more ongoing multipart uploads, as there
 * are more prefix directories.
